Simple Arduino LED Blink Project
This repository contains a simple electronic circuit project that uses an Arduino UNO to alternate blinking two LEDs, along with the corresponding code.

Project Description
The project features a flip-flop circuit setup where two LEDs blink in an alternating pattern. When one LED is on, the other is off, and this alternation continues cyclically. The process is controlled through the digital pins of the Arduino.

Circuit Diagram
The circuit is constructed on a breadboard using an Arduino UNO, two LEDs, two 220-ohm resistors, and jumper wires. One LED is connected to pin 10 and the other to pin 9. Resistors are connected to the long leg (anode) of each LED to limit the current and prevent the LEDs from burning out.


Code Explanation
c
Copy code
void setup() {
 pinMode(10,OUTPUT);
 pinMode(9,OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
   digitalWrite(10,HIGH);
   digitalWrite(9,LOW);
   delay(200);
   digitalWrite(9,HIGH);
   digitalWrite(10,LOW);
   delay(200);
}
The code sets up digital pins 10 and 9 on the Arduino as outputs. Inside the loop() function, one pin is set to HIGH and the other to LOW, and this state is maintained for 200 milliseconds. Then the states of the pins are switched, and this cycle repeats indefinitely.

Setup
To run this project on your system:

Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
Clone or download this repository.
Open the flip_flop.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Connect your Arduino UNO to your computer.
Select the correct port and board from the Tools menu.
Press the Upload button to upload the code to your Arduino.
The LEDs should start blinking alternately.
